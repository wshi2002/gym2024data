## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# load in libraries
package_list <- c("tidyverse", "vroom", "stringr", "dplyr")

for (package_name in package_list) {
  if (!requireNamespace(package_name, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(package_name)
  }
  library(package_name, character.only = TRUE)
}

# load in data
df <- vroom("cleandata/data_2022_2023.csv")

df_men <- df%>%
  filter(Gender == "m")


df_women <- df%>%
  filter(Gender == "w")



df_men <- df_men%>%
  mutate(first_name_only = word(FirstName, 1))


df_men%>%
  distinct(LastName, first_name_only)



df%>%
  mutate(
    clean_name = case_when(name == "asdf" ~ "abcd",
                           ...,
                           TRUE ~ name)
  )
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
